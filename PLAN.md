# Project PLAN

## Model Building for Candlestick Pattern Analysis
- Develop algorithms to identify key candlestick patterns in historical data.
- Implement backtesting to evaluate the effectiveness of the patterns on historical price movements.

## Introduction of Level 2 Data for Support/Resistance Levels
- Integrate level 2 market data to calculate precise support and resistance levels.
- Analyze how this data can impact order execution and trading strategies.

## Machine Learning Model Integration
- Select suitable machine learning models for prediction based on candlestick patterns and Level 2 data.
- Build a model pipeline for training, validation, and testing.

## Previously Outlined Steps
1. Conduct a literature review on candlestick patterns and their predictive capabilities.
2. Data collection from various sources to ensure diverse input.
3. Exploratory data analysis (EDA) to identify trends and correlations.
4. Implement trading strategy simulations based on model predictions.

## Project Goals
- To build a robust trading model that utilizes both traditional candlestick analysis and advanced level 2 data for optimizing trading decisions.
